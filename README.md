- 👋 Hi, I’m @simplecode41
- 👀 I’m interested in cyber security...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of cyber security...
- 💞️ I am seeking collaboration as a powerful method for tackling the ever increasing issues of cyberattacks. Working together allows us to use our shared knowledge, resources, and skills to improve threat detection, incident response, and overall security.

- 😄 Pronouns: While cybersecurity requires teamwork, you must also be able to work alone and without supervision. This requires you to be self-motivated and capable of managing yourself. Passion can motivate a person, but self-management allows you to have a significant influence on your organization's security as an individual and as part of a team.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Protecting individuals and companies from data breaches and incidents may be extremely satisfying. As a result, it's no wonder that cyber security specialists report some of the greatest levels of job satisfaction among all IT roles.
